# Forecasting Blue-Chip Stocks of PSX Using AI Methods

This project is a comparative analysis of two popular time-series forecasting models, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and Prophet, to predict the stock prices of blue-chip companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). This was originally developed as part of a research finaly year project for my bachelors.

## Overview

The core of this project lies in the two Jupyter notebooks, `GRU_Forecast.ipynb` and `Prophet_Forecast.ipynb`. These notebooks were initially developed in Google Colab and have been refactored to run locally, using the provided datasets. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of these AI methods in a real-world financial context and compare their performance.

## Datasets

The `data` directory contains historical stock data for the following 10 blue-chip companies listed on the PSX:

-   ATRL
-   ENGRO
-   HUBC
-   MARI
-   MTL
-   OGDC
-   POL
-   PPL
-   PSMC
-   UBL

## Models

This project explores two distinct forecasting models:

*   **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for time-series data. The `GRU_Forecast.ipynb` notebook contains the implementation of the GRU model.
*   **Prophet:** A time-series forecasting model developed by Facebook. It is designed to be easy to use and to handle the common features of business time-series data. The `Prophet_Forecast.ipynb` notebook contains the implementation of the Prophet model.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. You can change the target stock by modifying the `stock` variable in the "Parameter Adjustment" section of each notebook. The notebooks are set up to load the data from the `data` directory.
